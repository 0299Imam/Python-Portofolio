5. Analyzing the Impact of Screen Time on Mental Health.
        This project delves into the complex relationship between screen time and mental well-being, with a particular focus on its effects on adolescents and young adults. Utilizing data analysis and machine learning, the project aims to shed light on how digital device usage influences psychological health, identify key contributing factors, and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
   
Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to explore the correlation between daily screen usage and various mental health indicators, including stress, anxiety, and depression scores.
- Identification of Contributing Factors: Investigated and identified other significant factors and demographic variables, such as age and gender, that play a role in mental health conditions and modify the impact of screen time.
- Predictive Modeling of Mental Health Risk: Developed and implemented machine learning models to predict mental health risk levels based on patterns in screen time and other identified influential variables.
- Generation of Visual Insights and Recommendations: Created data-driven visual insights to effectively communicate findings and formulated practical recommendations tailored for stakeholders like educators, parents, and policymakers to mitigate potential negative impacts of excessive screen time.

Key Findings and Recommendations:

- The analysis revealed a notable link between increased screen usage and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.
- The impact of screen time on mental health was found to differ across age and gender groups, with younger individuals and women appearing to be more significantly affected.
- Age, sleep duration, and screen time were identified as important predictors of mental health issues.
- Based on these findings, the project recommends encouraging moderate screen use, raising awareness about the potential mental health risks of excessive screen time, and implementing targeted interventions for high-risk populations, such as young adults and women.

  **Technologies Used:** Python, RandomForest, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
